# Face Mask Detection using AI

This project implements a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques. It employs TensorFlow and Keras for model training and evaluation. The model is trained to classify images of individuals with and without face masks.

## Features

- Dataset preprocessing using image augmentation.
- Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification.
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report.
- Integration with Google Colab for cloud-based execution.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in the project:

- **TensorFlow and Keras**: For building and training the neural network.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit
